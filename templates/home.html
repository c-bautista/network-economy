### Introduction
This is a simulation of an economic credit network with three economic sectors (banks, downstream firms and upstream firms) holding credit relationships:

- **Banks sector**: They provide credit finance to both upstream and downstream firms.
- **Upstream firms sector**: They transform the primary goods into intermediate goods and sell them to the downstream firms. They borrow money from banks to finance its salary wage when needed.
- **Downstream firms sector**: They convert the intermediate goods into the final goods that will be finally sold to consumers. They buy the intermediate goods from the upstream firms through a comercial credit and borrow money from banks to finance its salary wage when needed.

At each period, downstream and upstream firms choose to connect to the bank that offers the lowest credit rate from a random sample of 5 banks. The downstream firms choose to connect to the upstream firm that offers the lowest comercial credit rate from a random sample of 5 upstream firms. As a result of the credit debts, firms can go bankrupt which, in turn, provokes unpaid debts to upstream firms and banks, possibly propagating the bankruptcies.

The network's implementation was based on <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/sites/jstiglitz/files/2009_Business_Fluctuations_and_Bankruptcy_Avalances.pdf">this article</a>. Please, refer to it for deeper insight. The complete implementation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/c-bautista/credit-network">this github repository</a>. Here, I focus on the impact of the bank credit on the network's evolution.

### Bank credit rate
The credit rate that banks charge to firms is given by the equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:credit_rate}
r = p A_b^{-p} + q (B/A_f)^q
%r = \sigma A_b ^{-\sigma} + \theta (B/A_f)^{\theta}
\end{equation}

where $A_b$ is the bank's net worth, $A_f$ is the firm's net worth and $B$ is the amount of credit required by the firm. $p$ and $q$ are positive parameters that control the importance of each term in equation (1).

Each term of equation (1) has a clear interpretation:

- The first term contains the information of the robustness of the bank in financial terms. When the bank has a low net worth, it increments the credit rate to reduce the amount of credit requirements. When the bank has a high net worth, it drops the credit rate allowing more clients to ask for credit. ** The banks net worth importance is controled by the parameter $p$**.

- The second term contains the information of the firms' financial strength. The ratio $B/A_f$ is the firms' leverage. Thus, the biggest the leverage, the biggest the credit rate. **The leverage importance in the computation of the credit rate is controled by the parameter $q$**.
